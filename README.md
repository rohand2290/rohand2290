# Introduction
Hello! I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying Mathematics/Computer Science. 

My love for technology and programming started when I installed [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) on my mom's old Dell Inspiron from 2006 and got to mess around with a Linux terminal. Later on, I built small-scale scripts to automate tasks and dabbled in making small Discord bots and social-media esque web apps with Spring Boot and React early on in high-school. Later on, it became more of a passive thing I pursued as I focused more of my effort on trying to maximize my GPA and pursue other types of extracurriculars. 

Starting off college, I was a premed student, with my eyes set on going into psychiatry or something with the mind. I realized that I actually really liked numbers and code more than I liked biology and anatomy. However, I'm interested in using the same Spring Boot stack I used as a 14 year old to architect high-performance, distributed systems, currently specializing within healthcare administration and electronic healthcare records (EHRs.)
