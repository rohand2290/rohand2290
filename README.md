# Introduction
Hello! I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying Mathematics/Computer Science. 

My love for technology and programming started when I installed [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) on my mom's old Dell Inspiron from 2006 and got to mess around with a Linux terminal. Later on, I built small-scale scripts to automate tasks and dabbled in making small Discord bots and social-media esque web apps with Spring Boot and React early on in high-school. Now, I'm interested in using the same Spring Boot stack to architect high-performance, distributed systems, currently specializing within healthcare administration and electronic healthcare records (EHRs.) 

My profile consists of:
* Side projects 

I'm interested in data engineering and creating interfaces which allow users to transform large amounts of data.
I'm also interested in open-source (Linux), functional programming, and creating predictive models.
Feel free to reach out!
