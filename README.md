# Introduction
Hello! I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying Computational and Systems Biology on the Pre-Med track.
This Github repo has some code for my classes and current projects that I'm working or have worked on in the past.

# Disclaimer
Starting soon, this Github repo will mirror my main [Gitea](https://git.rdesh.xyz/explore/repos) instance. 
Check there instead if you want to see where I actually host my code/tools that help me as a student.
