# Introduction
Hello! I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA.
My profile consists of:
* Shell scripts
* [Nix](https://nixos.org/) flakes
* Code for research projects
* Dotfiles
* Other side-projects I've been working on

I'm interested in data engineering and creating interfaces which allow users to transform large amounts of data.
I'm also interested in open-source (Linux), functional programming, and creating models.
Feel free to reach out!
