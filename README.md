# Introduction
Hello! I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying [Computational and Systems Biology](https://casb.ucla.edu/) on the Pre-Med track.
My profile consists of:
* Shell scripts
* [Nix](https://nixos.org/) flakes
* Code for research projects
* Other side-projects I've been working on

# Disclaimer
My Github profile mirrors my main [Gitea](https://git.rdesh.xyz/explore/repos) instance. 
Check there instead if you want to see where I host my code/tools that help me as a student.
